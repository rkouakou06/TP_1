# Family is important 

The purpose of this script is to show the ancestors and descendants of an animal. 

For this, we create a class called "_Animal_". Through this class, we can create animals. 
They have a mother and can have children with the _add_children_ function. 
We can also remove children (why not... :-D) with the _remove_children_ function. 
The function _my_ancestors_ allows to visualize the ancestry of an animal and the function _my_children_ allows to visualize its children.
